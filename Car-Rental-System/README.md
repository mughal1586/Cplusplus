Description
This C++ program simulates a car rental system. It allows adding cars to a rental company's fleet, displaying available cars, renting cars to customers, and returning cars.

Features
-   Defines a `Car` class to store car details (make, model, year).
-   Defines a `Customer` class to store customer details (name, ID).
-   Defines a `RentalCompany` class to manage the car fleet and car rentals.
-   Allows adding cars to the rental company's fleet.
-   Displays available cars.
-   Simulates the process of renting a car to a customer.
-   Simulates the process of returning a rented car.

Code Structure
The code consists of the following files:
-   `Car.h`: Contains the declaration of the `Car` class[cite: 4, 7].
-   `Car.cpp`: Contains the implementation of the `Car` class methods[cite: 4, 7].
-   `Customer.h`: Contains the declaration of the `Customer` class[cite: 5, 8].
-   `Customer.cpp`: Contains the implementation of the `Customer` class methods[cite: 5, 8].
-   `RentalCompany.h`: Contains the declaration of the `RentalCompany` class[cite: 1, 6].
-   `RentalCompany.cpp`: Contains the implementation of the `RentalCompany` class methods[cite: 1, 6].
-   `main.cpp`: Contains the main function that uses the classes to simulate the car rental system[cite: 3].

Dependencies
-   iostream: For input/output operations[cite: 4, 5, 7, 8].
-   string: For using string data type[cite: 4, 5, 7, 8].

Compilation and Execution
To compile and run the program, save the files with their respective .cpp and .h extensions (e.g., Car.h, Car.cpp, Customer.h, Customer.cpp, RentalCompany.h, RentalCompany.cpp, main.cpp) and use a C++ compiler.
